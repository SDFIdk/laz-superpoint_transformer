# laz-superpoint_transformer

This project is built on [superpoint_transformer](https://github.com/drprojects/superpoint_transformer) with added functionality for handling **.las / .laz** files directly.
It is used by the danish agency of climate data for processing lidar point clouds
Please have a look at the original project in order to learn more.

## 💻  Environment requirements
This project was tested with:
- Linux OS
- **64G** RAM
- NVIDIA Quadro RTX 8000  (49 Gig)

- CUDA 12.1

<br>

## 🏗  Installation
install_CUDA_ARCH_7_5.sh is setup for usage on GPU: Quadro RTX 8000
install.sh should work on a more modern GPU but have not been tested for this project. (see [superpoint_transformer](https://github.com/drprojects/superpoint_transformer) for more info on installation)


### Installation part 1.
In order for the installation to work you need cuda 12.1 and gcc-11
If there are problems with instaling cuda 12.1 , make sure to purge cuda from the system
### purge cuda and nvidia driver (only if needed ) 
sudo apt-get --purge remove 'cuda*'
sudo apt-get --purge remove 'libcublas*' 'libnccl*' 'libnpp*' 'libcufft*' 'libcurand*' 'libcusolver*' 'libcusparse*'
sudo apt-get autoremove
sudo apt-get autoclean
sudo rm -rf /usr/local/cuda*
### install nvidia driver (only if needed)

### install cuda 12.1 
Follow instructions from link below with one change . 
replace the last install comand to this if you allready have installed the nvidia driver 
sudo apt-get -y install cuda-toolkit-12-1
(https://developer.nvidia.com/cuda-12-1-0-download-archive)


### install gcc-11
sudo apt install gcc-11 g++-11
### Installation part 2.
please note that two different .sh scripts are provided for installation. install.sh and install_CUDA_ARCH_7_5.sh depending on the GPU you have acess to
Simply run [`install.sh`](install.sh) to install all dependencies in a new conda environment 
named `spt`. 
```bash
# Creates a conda env named 'spt' env and installs dependencies
./install.sh
```

## 🚀  Usage
### Prediction
Given a folder with .laz files you can classify all points in the laz files with 
```bash
python python predict_many.py --inputlaz path/to/(folder or las.laz) --output_folder path/to/outputfolder --ckpt_path path/to/checkpoints/a_file.ckpt
```

To classify the example dataset with a pretrained model do the following 

python download_model.py
python predict_many.py --inputlaz /mnt/T/mnt/trainingdata/bygningsudpegning/hf_strandbo_1km2/laz/1km_6173_728.laz --output_folder /mnt/T/mnt/trainingdata/bygningsudpegning/hf_strandbo_1km2/predi>


### Training

Some examples:

```bash
# Train SPT on the toy_laz_dataset that comes with the repo
python src/train.py experiment=semantic/vox025toy_laz_dataset.yaml


### CUDA Out-Of-Memory Errors
Having some CUDA OOM errors 💀💾 ? Here are some parameters you can play 
with to mitigate GPU memory use, based on when the error occurs.
